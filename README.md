# Advanced-Database-Management-Systems

This repository holds all exercises in my Advanced Database Management class.

The class was used to teach [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and [Mongo Shell](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell). 

The class was also used to better understand/read [documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/crud/).

[Exercise 1](example_schema.txt) was used to demonstrate the schema of a document based database system.

[Exercise 2](queries.txt) was used to demonstrate queries in a document based database system.

[Exercise 3](class_API_route_exercise.txt) was used to demonstrate how routes for [REST API's](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/02/best-practices-for-rest-api-design/) work.

[Exercise 4](Aggregation_Exercises.txt) was used to demonstrate aggregation in MongoDB.
